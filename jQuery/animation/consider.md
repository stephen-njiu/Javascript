## Important Considerations
 * Generally, it is better to do animation in CSS, if at all possible. When animation is done in CSS, the computer's GPU can be used to help with the processing of the animation. 
 * This will make animations smoother and more efficient. You will particularly notice this on phones, especially older phones
 * However, the effects library in JQuery is really easy to use and for something minor or if you need something quick, it can be a great option.
